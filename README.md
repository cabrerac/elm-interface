# eXplainable Learning Models - Interface

This project builds the interface for the eXplainable Learning Models (XLM) system based on Large Language Models (LLMs).

The XLM system parametrises learning models using a Data-Oriented Architecture. The system also offers a question/answering interface where users can ask about the parametrisation process 
of the learning model using natural language.
